=====================================================================================

NAS-Pi is a project meant to turn your Raspberry Pi into a network attached storage
system.  You can create user accounts, assign permissions to user groups, and
add all sorts of mount points for local devices and remote machines.

Being modular, it is fairly simple to drop in or create new functionality.  So far,
there are modules for maintaining user accounts and groups, mounting filesystems,
and searching bittorrent using btguru, with the ability to control Transmission.

How to Install:

	git clone git://github.com/gurudvlp/NAS-Pi.git
	cd NAS-Pi

Then simply point your favorite web browser to the IP of your Raspberry Pi.
